What is it?
===========

drng.dk is an open-source link-shortening service with useful statistics and an
open API. [Why use it?](http://drng.dk/!doc/why-use-it)

The project is developed and maintained by Niels Roesen
"[hypesystem](http://hypesystem.dk)" Abildgaard, a student of
Softwaredevelopment at the IT-University of Copenhagen.

Libraries
---------

drng.dk uses several third-party libraries for it's services:

 * jQuery runs most things on the website, including API calls and nice, smooth
   effects.
 * Highcharts.js provides the fantastically good-looking graphs on the
   statistics pages.
 * ZeroClipboard provides a link for copying the url of a link created.
 * PHP Markdown translates the Markdown docs (like this one) into regular HTML,
   making it look nice and fancy.
